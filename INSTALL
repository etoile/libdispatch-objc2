libdispatch INSTALL
===================

This is customized libdispatch based on http://nickhutchinson.me/libdispatch/ (the snapshot is from April 18, 2013 and corresponds to the Git commit a2a2f375902cf738ba75c2ff33f0f422e630b102).

The patch libdispatch-libobjc2.patch has been applied to the libdispatch snapshot. The patch written by Niels Grewe was taken from here: http://www.halbordnung.de/~niels.grewe/gnustep/libdispatch-libobjc2.patch


libobjc2 Compatibility Discussion
---------------------------------

This is a temporary solution until libBlocksRuntime symbols are turned into weak symbols, and libobjc2 can override them. 

Patching libBlocksRuntime is more complex than just patching libdispatch, because it requires compiling your own libdispatch in addition to libBlocksRuntime. A packaged libdispatch won't use a custom libBlocksRuntime afaik.

For the background behind this patched libdispatch:

- http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/discuss-gnustep/2012-08/msg00094.html
- https://github.com/nickhutchinson/libdispatch/issues/2
- http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk/BlocksRuntime (the official libBlocksRuntime repository)


Linux vs FreeBSD Compatibility
------------------------------

This libdispatch is originally a port to Linux, so it is unknow whether it works on FreeBSD or not.


Build & Install
---------------

Building the library requires a recent CMake version, at least 2.8. For old systems, you need to grab it from CMake website. For example, for Ubuntu 12.04, just download a binary and put it in your PATH environment variable:

wget http://www.cmake.org/files/v2.8/cmake-2.8.12-Linux-i386.tar.gz
tar -xvf cmake-2.8.12-Linux-i386.tar.gz
export PATH=~/cmake-2.8.12-Linux-i386/bin:$PATH

Once the dependencies are installed, build and install libdispatch:

mkdir libdispatch/Build
cd libdispatch/Build
cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make && sudo -E make install


Testing
-------

To test if the built libdispatch works, run test.sh:

./test.sh

You should get the following output (or something close):

Strawberry fields...
<dispatch_test.c content>
Dispatch I/O wrote everything to stdout. Hurrah.
Strawberry fields...
Strawberry fields...
Strawberry fields...
etc.


Grabbing and Patching libdispatch Snapshot
------------------------------------------

If you want a more recent snaspshot: 

sudo rm -r libdispatch
git clone git://github.com/nickhutchinson/libdispatch.git
patch -p0 < ./libdispatch-libobjc2.patch // the patch doesn't apply cleanly so you need to tweak the results
